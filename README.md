# Project description
VPNs are crucial for modern network privacy and a prominent experience into network security. Our goal is to build a functional vpn, since we have suffered from unavailable to access our desired sites overseas as international students. We hope this project can boost our network fundamentals, including packets and protocols, exploring security and encryption and vigilance in real world applications.
